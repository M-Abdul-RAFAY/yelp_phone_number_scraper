# Yelp Scraper Improvements

## Fixed Issues

The Yelp scraper has been significantly improved to fix the issues with extracting:

- ‚úÖ **Review Count**
- ‚úÖ **Website URL**
- ‚úÖ **Business Hours**
- ‚úÖ **Categories**

## What Was Improved

### 1. Review Count Extraction (`extract_review_count`)

- **Added multiple modern selectors** for different Yelp page layouts
- **Improved regex patterns** to handle comma-separated numbers (e.g., "1,234 reviews")
- **Added fallback search** in page source for review patterns
- **Better error handling** with multiple element attempts

**New selectors include:**

- `span[data-font-weight='semibold'] a[href*='#reviews']`
- `a[href*='#reviews'] span[data-font-weight='semibold']`
- `*[aria-label*='review']:not(button):not(input)`

### 2. Website URL Extraction (`extract_website`)

- **Enhanced filtering** to exclude social media links (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)
- **Multiple fallback strategies** including page source parsing
- **Better URL validation** and cleaning
- **Support for various website URL formats**

**New features:**

- Excludes social media URLs automatically
- Searches contact/info sections specifically
- Regex patterns for common website formats (.com, .org, .net)

### 3. Business Hours Extraction (`extract_business_hours`)

- **Comprehensive selector coverage** for different table and div structures
- **Smart text filtering** to identify actual hours vs. other content
- **Pattern matching** for day names and time indicators
- **Fallback regex search** in page source

**Improved logic:**

- Validates content contains day names (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- Checks for time indicators (am, pm, closed, open)
- Cleans and formats the extracted text properly

### 4. Categories Extraction (`extract_categories`)

- **Expanded selector coverage** for category links and spans
- **Multiple extraction strategies** including parent element searching
- **Duplicate removal** while preserving order
- **Text cleaning and validation**

**New approaches:**

- Searches for category links in various page sections
- Looks for `href*='/c/'` patterns more comprehensively
- Fallback regex patterns in page source

### 5. Enhanced Main Scraping Function (`scrape_business_info`)

- **Better page load waiting** with multiple fallback elements
- **Progressive extraction** with status indicators
- **Improved error handling** for each extraction step
- **Enhanced logging** to track extraction progress

**New features:**

- Visual progress indicators (üìç üìû üåê etc.)
- Multiple business name selectors as fallback
- Additional 2-second wait for dynamic content
- Detailed success/failure reporting

## Usage

The scraper is now more robust and should successfully extract all the requested fields. Run it with:

```bash
python yelp_search_scraper.py
```

Or test a single business with:

```bash
python test_scraper.py
```

## Expected Improvements

With these changes, you should see:

- **Higher success rates** for all extraction fields
- **More accurate data** with better validation
- **Better error recovery** when elements are missing
- **Detailed progress tracking** during scraping

The scraper now uses modern CSS selectors and multiple fallback strategies to handle Yelp's dynamic page structure more reliably.
