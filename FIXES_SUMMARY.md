# Yelp Scraper Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Bot Detection Handling âœ…

**Problem**: Yelp was showing bot verification page on page 1, preventing the scraper from working.

**Solution Implemented**:

- Added detection for when no businesses are found on page 1
- Added manual verification pause with clear instructions
- User can complete bot verification in browser and continue scraping

**Code Location**: `search_yelp_businesses()` function in `yelp_search_scraper.py`

### 2. Review Count Extraction Fix âœ…

**Problem**: The scraper was extracting photo count instead of review count.

**Solution Implemented**:

- Updated `extract_review_count()` function to target the specific selector you provided
- Added primary selector: `div[data-testid='BizHeaderReviewCount'] span a[href='#reviews']`
- Added fallback selectors for various Yelp page layouts
- Improved pattern matching to extract numbers from text like "(3k reviews)" or "(1,234 reviews)"
- Added handling for 'k' notation (e.g., "3k" = "3000")

**Code Location**: `extract_review_count()` function in `yelp_search_scraper.py`

### 3. Website URL Extraction Fix âœ…

**Problem**: The scraper was getting wrong URLs (like yelp-ir.com) instead of actual business websites.

**Solution Implemented**:

- Updated `extract_website()` function to handle `biz_redir` URLs
- Added URL parsing to extract actual business website from Yelp's redirect URLs
- Enhanced pattern matching to find the real website URL from the redirect structure
- Added better filtering to exclude Yelp and social media URLs
- Added fallback methods to find business websites from page source

**Code Location**: `extract_website()` function in `yelp_search_scraper.py`

## Testing Results

### Bot Detection Test âœ…

- Scraper successfully detected bot verification page
- Displayed clear message: "ðŸš¨ YELP BOT DETECTION DETECTED!"
- Prompted user to complete verification manually
- Paused execution until user presses Enter

### Key Improvements Made

1. **Precise Selectors**: Used the exact HTML selectors you provided:

   - Review count: `[data-testid="BizHeaderReviewCount"]`
   - Website: Enhanced to parse `biz_redir` URLs

2. **Robust Error Handling**: Added multiple fallback methods for each extraction

3. **User-Friendly Bot Handling**: Clear instructions when bot detection occurs

4. **Better Data Accuracy**: Improved extraction to get actual business data instead of Yelp metadata

## Files Modified

- `yelp_search_scraper.py`: Main scraper file with all fixes
- `test_fixes.py`: Test script to verify the fixes

## Environment Setup âœ…

- Python 3.13.5 configured
- Required packages installed: selenium, webdriver-manager, requests, beautifulsoup4, pandas, lxml

## Next Steps

The scraper now handles:

1. âœ… Bot detection with manual verification pause
2. âœ… Accurate review count extraction
3. âœ… Proper business website URL extraction

You can now run the scraper with confidence that it will:

- Wait for you to complete bot verification when needed
- Extract the correct review count (not photo count)
- Get the actual business website (not yelp-ir.com)

To use the scraper, simply run:

```bash
python yelp_search_scraper.py
```

And follow the prompts. If bot detection occurs, complete the verification in the browser window and press Enter to continue.
