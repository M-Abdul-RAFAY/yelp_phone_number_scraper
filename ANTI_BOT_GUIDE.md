# Enhanced Anti-Bot Detection Guide for Yelp Scraper

## üö® Current Issue

Yelp has detected automated behavior and is showing:

> "You have been blocked. Why? Something about the behaviour of the browser has caught our attention."

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Anti-Detection Measures Implemented

### 1. **Advanced Browser Stealth** üïµÔ∏è

- **Randomized User Agents**: Rotates between 5 recent Chrome user agents
- **Enhanced JavaScript Stealth**: Removes webdriver properties and adds realistic browser fingerprints
- **Realistic Window Sizes**: Random viewport dimensions
- **Browser Preferences**: Realistic notification and geolocation settings

### 2. **Human-Like Behavior Simulation** üßë‚Äçüíª

- **Homepage Visit**: Always visits Yelp homepage first to establish session
- **Natural Scrolling**: Simulates reading behavior with random scrolling patterns
- **Extended Delays**: 5-12 second delays between businesses (up from 1-3 seconds)
- **Periodic Breaks**: Every 3rd business includes 10-20 second "coffee breaks"
- **Reading Simulation**: Scrolls through pages like a human reading content

### 3. **Enhanced Bot Detection Handling** ü§ñ

- **Comprehensive Detection**: Monitors for 15+ bot detection indicators
- **Detailed Manual Instructions**: Step-by-step verification guide
- **Session Recovery**: Re-applies stealth measures after manual verification
- **Page Analysis**: Checks page titles and content to ensure proper navigation

### 4. **Improved Error Recovery** üîÑ

- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Multiple selector strategies for finding business links
- **Alternative Link Discovery**: Fallback methods when standard selectors fail
- **Smart Retries**: Automatically retries pages that fail to load properly

## üìã Manual Steps When Blocked

When you see the bot detection message:

1. ‚úÖ **Complete Verification**: Solve any CAPTCHA or verification challenge
2. ‚úÖ **Browse Manually**: Spend 30-60 seconds browsing normally:
   - Scroll up and down
   - Click on a few businesses
   - Use the search bar
   - Close any popups
3. ‚úÖ **Return to Search**: Navigate back to your search results page
4. ‚úÖ **Continue Scraper**: Press ENTER in the terminal to continue

## üí° Additional Recommendations

### For Better Success:

- **Use VPN**: Change IP address if heavily blocked
- **Smaller Batches**: Scrape fewer businesses per session (5-10 max)
- **Multiple Sessions**: Split large scraping jobs across multiple sessions
- **Different Times**: Try scraping at different times of day
- **Residential Proxy**: Consider using residential proxy services

### Browser Settings:

- **Keep Browser Open**: Don't close the browser between sessions
- **Manual Browsing**: Do some manual browsing on Yelp before running scraper
- **Clear Data**: Occasionally clear browser data and start fresh

## üîß Technical Improvements Made

### Browser Configuration:

```python
# Enhanced stealth measures
- Randomized user agents from pool of 5 recent Chrome versions
- Disabled automation indicators
- Realistic browser preferences
- Random window sizes
- Enhanced JavaScript stealth execution
```

### Behavioral Simulation:

```python
# Human-like timing
- Homepage visit: 2-4 seconds
- Page loading: 3-6 seconds
- Between pages: 3-7 seconds
- Between businesses: 5-12 seconds
- Periodic breaks: 10-20 seconds every 3rd business
```

### Detection Monitoring:

```python
# Comprehensive bot detection indicators
bot_indicators = [
    'verify', 'captcha', 'robot', 'security check', 'unusual traffic',
    'blocked', 'suspicious', 'automation', 'bot', 'verify you are human',
    'prove you are not a robot', 'please verify', 'access denied',
    'rate limit', 'too many requests', 'temporarily blocked'
]
```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Enhanced Scraper**:

   ```bash
   python yelp_search_scraper.py
   ```

2. **When Bot Detection Occurs**:

   - Follow the detailed on-screen instructions
   - Complete verification manually
   - Browse naturally for 30-60 seconds
   - Press ENTER to continue

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Watch for "üö® YELP BOT DETECTION DETECTED!" messages
   - Be ready to intervene manually when needed
   - Let the scraper handle stealth delays automatically

## ‚ö° Quick Tips

- **Start Small**: Test with 1-2 pages first
- **Be Patient**: The enhanced delays are necessary for stealth
- **Stay Alert**: Be ready to complete manual verification
- **Monitor Logs**: Watch the terminal output for guidance

The enhanced scraper now includes sophisticated anti-detection measures, but Yelp's security is constantly evolving. Manual intervention may still be needed occasionally.
